# Chatbot_with-_RAG_and_Vector_Database

This project implements an AI-powered chatbot for movie-related queries using Streamlit and LangChain frameworks. The chatbot integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance response accuracy by retrieving relevant information from a pdf.

## Features
### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): 
Integrates information retrieval to enhance chatbot responses.
### User Interface: 
Streamlit-based interface for easy interaction.
### PDF:
Utilizes a PDF containing Prompt Engineering information.
